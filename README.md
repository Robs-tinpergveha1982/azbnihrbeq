OMG, so I just got out of the theater and wow I’m kinda reeling still - you know that feeling when you emerge from the dark and there's awkwardly bright lights and ppl chattering with a buzz like static? That's what it’s like in my head rn after watching The Electric State.

It’s this mind-bending visual, like someone decided to animate a Dali painting and asked: “What if this was America?” Except it's an America that’s so drained of color it felt like a dishonest sepia, kinda - oh, wait, no popcorn crumbs everywhere on my jeans (again oy) - like it was mimicking a world it forgot. Some robot was there and it wasn't metallic C-3PO cool, just sad and tired, sorta like the theater seats after they've been sat on for like a decade.

And that thing she does, Michelle (or Mish, yeah I think it’s Mish in my head now) with the photos or maybe the maps - idk it spoke to this weird, forgotten nostalgia I didn't think I even had, like hoofing a classic old book you didn't remember owning. The air smelled of buttered popcorn but it was mothballs in my memories - how?? I can’t even begin to mirror that feeling correctly, jeez.

> Everything was draped in this weird silence, and I thought I heard echoes of a ghostlike Sinatra crooning - or maybe it was just someone’s phone? Or my brain doing weird replay. The noise here is just an ongoing hum, or maybe that was the film’s fault, still hear the digital chimes and hums blending.

There’s this shot, hues of tangerine, a highway stretching to an endless void. Like if a Monopoly board decided to surrender to infinity. Wow I just remembered, someone asked if they could download the movie or wait n’ watch the movie later, and I was like - how do you even risk downloading a vibe like this?? It’s streaming in my brain now, unironically.

Anyway my back's aching - like stone slabs for seats I swear. Oh but there’s also her eyes - whoa they were so full, paradox appearing lively and dead at one go, just a glance — and the night neon skies…those skies, dude, are def like e-cotton candy spun by Willy Wonka himself after a long day.

Almost forgot, here’s an error message, I swear it magically appeared in my browser earlier:
```javascript
function somethingWeird() {
    for(let i = sigh; i < huh; i++) {
        console.log('Where am I');
        if(clouds.areDigital) return 'Not an answer';
    }
}
```
